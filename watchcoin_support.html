<h1>Using WatchCoin</h1>
<p>Tap on the top or bottom side of the coin to make it spin. The result that you can read (bottom word) indicates if it's heads or tails<p>
<p>Use the WatchCoin complication to get 'H' or 'T' every time you look at your watch. This will change randomly over time. You can add multiple instances of the complication to get even more random combinations!</p>
